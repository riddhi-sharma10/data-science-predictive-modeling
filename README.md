# 📊 Data Science & Predictive Modeling Project

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow — from cleaning and preprocessing an unstructured dataset to performing EDA, statistical analysis, model building, and final evaluation. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights and build an accurate predictive model using Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
- Cleaned and pre-processed a real-world unstructured dataset.  
- Performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.  
- Applied statistical techniques to validate observations.  
- Built, trained, and evaluated multiple machine learning models.  
- Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and error metrics.
